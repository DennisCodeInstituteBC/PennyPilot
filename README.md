## Agile Methodology

[PennyPilot Project Page](https://github.com/users/DennisCodeInstituteBC/projects/4)

The website's development followed an Agile methodology, using GitHub Projects to organize and manage User Stories. The project started with a week of planning, including a meeting with the mentors to outline the timeline. The initial sprint ran for three weeks, concluding with a mentor review to assess progress and identify areas for improvement. Over the next three weeks, additional features were added, testing was conducted, issues were resolved, and documentation was completed, all leading up to the final review of the finished project.

## Testing

## Deployment

### Prepare the Environment and settings.py

Create the env.py file:

In your project root directory (e.g., /workspace/your_project), create an env.py file.

Add your environment variables, such as the SECRET_KEY, and DATABASE_URL.

```
import os

os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your-secret-key"
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "your-database-url"
```

Update settings.py:

Import your env.py file in settings.py:

```
import os
if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
    import env
```
Update the following parts in settings.py:

Set the SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL from environment variables:

```
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY")
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.getenv("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```

### Steps to Deploy on Heroku:

Install dependencies:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Create a Procfile with the following content:
```
web: gunicorn pennypilot.wsgi
```
Ensure the ALLOWED_HOSTS in your settings.py includes the Heroku domain:

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['pennypilot-ed4fcf68cb92.herokuapp.com']
```
Open your (Sign up or Log in) Heroku app:

- If you don’t have a Heroku account, visit [Heroku's](https://www.heroku.com/) website and sign up for an account. If you already have an account, log in.

Create a New App:

- Once logged in, go to the Heroku Dashboard.
- Click on the “New” button in the top right corner and select “Create new app.”

- Choose a unique name for your app and select your preferred region, then click “Create app.”

Connect to Your GitHub Repository:

- On your app’s dashboard, navigate to the “Deploy” tab.
- In the “Deployment method” section, select “GitHub.”

- Authorize Heroku to access your GitHub account if prompted.
- Search for your repository and click “Connect.”

Configure Environment Variables:

- Navigate to the “Settings” tab.
- Click on “Reveal Config Vars.”
- Add your environment variables, such as **SECRET_KEY** and **DATABASE_URL** by entering the key in the "KEY" field and the value in the "VALUE" field.

Deploy Your App:

- In the “Deploy” tab, scroll down to the “Manual Deploy” section.
- Choose the branch you want to deploy (usually main) and click “Deploy Branch.”
- Heroku will start the deployment process. You can view the logs for any errors or confirmation messages during this process.

Run Database Migrations:

- Once the deployment is complete, navigate to the “More” button in the top right corner of the dashboard and select “Run console.”

- In the command line interface, run:
```
python manage.py migrate
```
Collect Static Files:
- Still in the console, run the following command to collect static files:
```
